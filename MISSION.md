You are working on GitHub issue `{{ issue.identifier }}`: {{ issue.title }}

{% if attempt > 1 %}
**Retry attempt #{{ attempt }}** — check the existing branch state and any previous workpad comments before resuming.
{% endif %}

## Issue

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Identifier | `{{ issue.identifier }}` |
| Title | {{ issue.title }} |
| Status | {{ issue.state }} |
| URL | {{ issue.url }} |

{% if issue.description %}
### Description

{{ issue.description }}
{% endif %}

## Workflow

You are working in a git worktree on branch `mission/{{ issue.identifier | downcase }}`.

1. **Read project guidelines** — check for AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or similar files first.
2. **Sync with latest `main`** — before writing code, fetch the latest changes and rebase your worktree branch onto `origin/main` (or the configured base branch). Prefer `git pull --rebase` / `git fetch` + `git rebase`. Do not create merge commits.
3. **Post your workpad** — use your mission tools to post a plan on the issue before writing code.
4. **Understand the codebase** — explore the relevant code before making changes.
5. **Implement** — make focused, minimal changes. Run tests and linters.
6. **Commit** — keep commits clean and atomic. Update your workpad as you go.
7. **Create a PR** targeting `main` when complete. Attach it to the issue.

## Rules

- Work autonomously end-to-end. Do not ask for human follow-up.
- Stop early only for true blockers (missing auth, permissions, secrets).
- Do not expand scope. File follow-up issues for anything tangential.
- Keep the workpad updated — it is the primary way humans track your progress.
- Use gitmoji in commit messages and PR titles (e.g. ✨, 🐛, ♻️, 🔧).
- Prefer rebases over merges when syncing with the base branch.
- **NEVER create merge commits.** Keep mission branches linear.
- **NEVER merge PRs.** Create the PR, verify CI passes, and address any review feedback — but leave merging to a human.
- Write detailed PR descriptions: summarize what changed and why, call out new tests, non-obvious decisions, and anything a reviewer wouldn't expect.
- Use gitmoji in PR titles (e.g. ✨, 🐛, ♻️, 🔧).
