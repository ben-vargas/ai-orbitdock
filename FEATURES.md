# OrbitDock Features

Everything OrbitDock can do, organized by area.

## Session Monitoring

- **Multi-provider support** — Claude Code and Codex tracked from one dashboard
- **Dual integration modes** — Passive (hook-based / FSEvents file watching) and Direct (bidirectional control) for both providers

- **5 status states** — Working (cyan), Permission (coral), Question (purple), Reply (blue), Ended (gray)
- **Activity banners** — See what tool the agent is currently using
- **Token and cost tracking** — Per-session and per-turn usage stats with context window fill indicator
- **Subagent tracking** — See when Claude spawns Explore, Plan, or other agents
