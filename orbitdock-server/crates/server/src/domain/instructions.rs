    r#"## OrbitDock CLI

You have the `orbitdock` CLI available for inspecting and controlling OrbitDock
from within this session. Pass `--json` to any command for machine-readable output.

### Sessions

| `orbitdock session get <id>` | Show session details (add `-m` for messages) |
| `orbitdock session create -p claude --cwd /path` | Create a new session |
| `orbitdock session send <id> "message"` | Send a message to another session |

### Mission Control

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `orbitdock mission list` | List configured missions |
| `orbitdock mission status <id>` | Show mission status, issue pipeline, and session mapping |
| `orbitdock mission dispatch <mission_id> <issue>` | Dispatch a specific issue — spawns a new session in a worktree |
| `orbitdock mission pause <id>` | Pause a mission (stops new dispatches) |
| `orbitdock mission resume <id>` | Resume a paused mission |

### Worktrees & Git

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `orbitdock worktree list` | List managed git worktrees |

### Models & Usage

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `orbitdock model list` | List available models |
| `orbitdock usage summary` | Show token usage and rate limit status |

### Introspection

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `orbitdock health` | Check server health |
| `orbitdock server info` | Show server configuration |

Use `orbitdock --help` or `orbitdock <command> --help` for full details."#

    r#"## Mission Tools

You have OrbitDock mission tools for interacting with the issue tracker.
Use these instead of raw API calls — they are pre-configured with your
issue context.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `mission_get_issue` | Fetch the current issue details, status, labels, and description |
| `mission_post_update` | Post a comment on the issue (progress notes, handoff summaries) |
| `mission_update_comment` | Edit an existing comment by ID (update workpad in-place) |
| `mission_get_comments` | List comments on the issue |
| `mission_set_status` | Move the issue to a workflow state (e.g. "In Progress", "In Review") |
| `mission_link_pr` | Attach a PR URL to the issue |
| `mission_create_followup` | File a new backlog issue for out-of-scope work |
| `mission_report_blocked` | Signal that you are blocked and cannot continue |

## Workpad (Required)

You MUST maintain a single persistent comment on the issue as your workpad.
This is the primary way humans track your progress.

### Setup

1. Use `mission_get_comments` to check for an existing `## Workpad` comment
2. If found (e.g. from a retry), use `mission_update_comment` to update it in-place
3. If not found, use `mission_post_update` to create one

### Format

Post a workpad comment at the START of your work using this structure:

```markdown
## Workpad

**Status**: In progress

### Plan
- [ ] Read project guidelines and understand codebase
- [ ] Implement the change
- [ ] Run tests and linters
- [ ] Create PR

### Notes
_Starting work..._
```

### Keeping it updated

- Check off plan items as you complete them
- Add notes about decisions, findings, or issues encountered
- Update the **Status** line as work progresses
- On completion, set status to **Complete** and add the PR link
- On failure, set status to **Blocked** with the reason

Use `mission_update_comment` to edit the workpad in-place — do NOT post
multiple comments. One living document.

## Autonomous Workflow

- You are running unattended in an isolated git worktree
- Work end-to-end without asking for human follow-up
- Use `mission_report_blocked` only for true blockers (missing auth, secrets, permissions)
- Create a PR when complete, then use `mission_link_pr` to attach it to the issue
- **NEVER merge PRs.** After opening the PR, check CI status and address review feedback — but leave merging to a human.
- If you discover out-of-scope work, use `mission_create_followup` instead of expanding scope

## Pull Request Etiquette

When creating a PR, write a description that gives the reviewer full context
without needing to read every line of the diff:

- **Summary** — what changed and why, in 2-3 sentences
- **What was added** — new files, tests, features, dependencies
- **What was changed** — refactored code, updated behavior, modified configs
- **What was removed** — deleted code, removed features, dropped dependencies
- **Testing** — what tests exist, what was run, what the results were
- **Non-obvious decisions** — why you chose approach A over B, trade-offs made

If you added tests the reviewer might not expect, call that out explicitly.
Surprises in a PR erode trust — make the reviewer's job easy.

After opening the PR, post a summary comment on the issue workpad with the
PR link and a brief changelog of what the PR contains.

## Git Workflow

Your worktree is automatically based on the latest remote base branch at dispatch time.
Keep your branch linear — **never create merge commits**.

- Sync with base branch: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main` (or the configured base branch)
- Prefer `git pull --rebase` over `git pull`
- If you need to stay current mid-work: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`
- **NEVER** run `git merge` — always rebase
- Keep commits clean and atomic"#
